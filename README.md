# CheckURLs
A simple program that checks the provided URLs for their response, both on http and https, and depending on the type of redirect behavior that is configured (currently configured in the code) continues querying and lists the response in a comma separated value list.

*Usage*: simply start the program to provide your list of URLs via Stdin, or specify an argument with a file name to let the program read URLs from the specified file.
